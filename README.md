# Server_Bot
Work done regarding Server_Bot - an autonomous serving robot for the Indian Kitchen.

Objective:-

To create an autonomous UGV with object detection and avoidance capabilities with a LiDAR. 
Performed and leveraged  GMapping, AMCL, and move_base (using DWA and TEB planners) to create the autonomous nature of a robots with a global and local costmap, which take care of all dynamic obstacles. 
This was tuned to the physical robot's size using the footprint parameters.
Done on simulation and in real life.
